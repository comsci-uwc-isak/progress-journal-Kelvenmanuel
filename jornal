today was my first computer science class, I think was good, I like the teacher, he gave us exercices that made us think and think, I enjoy the lessons, the chalanges and stay out of my comfort zone 

today, 04/09/2019, we explore more the terminal, we study or teacher teach us how to create a program,  I learn how to create a program,
05/09/2019 we continued the lesson about terminal, we talk and discuss about legacy system, where teacher brought a video that show more about this legacy system, we learn new codes and create new and di$
11/09/2019, the computer science lesson continous and we learn more and more codes but these codes althought they are very useful,they make me confuse and with time i am learning the first codes and the $
16/09/2019, today we correct the homeworks, we evalueted each other about a especific program and we made some For loops
18/09/2019, today we spent most of the time reading, and made a summary, I could understand some things about the documents that I red and later we make a program to create 100 files and we add new docum$

WHAT ARE THESE TWO TOPICS ?
these two topics are the art of programming trough flowcharts and algorithms

HOW DID WE EXPLORE THESE TWO TOPICS IN CLASS TODAY ?
we were using them when we were making the frame program and draw a diagram of that system, they help us to make the program easier and without repetitions, instead to put so many numbers we use those
algorithms to represents the numbers

today 27/09/19 we learn and make diagrams for one system and we keep working in the rental car problem 
today 30/09/19 we make two programs about the rental car program: create and record, we keep study datas and ways of make our programs efficients.
today 02/10/19 we made slides to explain the steps of our programs, and we defined the problem and we proposed solution for the p$
 we were talking about the steps to make programs that are going to work inside the car application and these things help us to u$

today 03/10/13, each of us show the steps to make one of the program that will be part of our project, with this we could correct$

today 07/10/19 we keep on our season to solve the rental car problem, we create new files, we corrected some mistake and we updat$
